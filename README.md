## What it can do
* .json
     all your jsons in one place
     automatic bookmarking; shows only selected bookmark content
     syntax coloring
  
* .txt
     designed for nicely colored notes
     bookmarking via ## and # + navigation on click

* BOTH  
   * undo/redo
   * expand/collapse bookmarks
   * use REPLACE function via Find & Replace
        simple Replace: replace every word (Find) with yours (Replace) in opened window
        Replace Selected: do the operation for all selected bookmarks
        Replace Everything: do the operation for the whole .json
        ... i don't have function for replacing words in all .jsons that'd be messy ...
  
* GUI/UI/UX:
    post-anarchy punk theme
    no windows panel (control via hotkeys)
    everything visible (no drop-downs, no menu)
    overwrite save without asking bcs you are speed
    bookmarks of loaded files
